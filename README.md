# file-finder-cli
Simple cli in python to search for files (for some reason its taking long time for OS build in tools)

**Project will not be continued** - I recognized that i was trying to build somethihng that already exists (grep command), but still it was good opportunity to learn more about async operations in python. 

If you still want to use it, usage is pretty simple -

```python main.py <parameters>```

as parameters you have to provide -i as input and for additional parameters, you can use `--help` command
